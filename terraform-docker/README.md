## Getting Started with Terraform and Docker

### Introduction

A provider in Terraform is an abstraction for a resource API written in a programming language. Terraform supports a variety of providers that can be created for anything with an API, such as cloud providers like Google and Azure, infrastructure providers like VMware or Docker, and even non-IT providers like Domino's Pizza, which once had a Terraform provider for ordering pizza.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to set up a Docker provider in Terraform to start scripting with Docker.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need the following:

- Terraform installed on your machine
- Docker installed on your machine

### Setting Up the Docker Provider

1. Create a new directory for your Terraform code and name it "Terraform Docker".
2. Create a new file named "main.tf" within the "Terraform Docker" directory. You can use any name for this file as long as it ends with ".tf".
3. Add the following code to the "main.tf" file to set up the Docker provider:

   ```terraform
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       docker = {
         source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
         version = "~> 2.0"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "docker" {
   }

4. Save the "main.tf" file.
5. Open a terminal in the "Terraform Docker" directory and run the following command to initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
This command will download the Docker provider and initialize Terraform.

### Setting Up the Docker Image Resource

1. Open the existing Terraform configuration file, e.g. `main.tf`.
2. Add the following code to the file to define the Docker image resource:

    ```terraform
    resource "docker_image" "nodered_image" {
      name = "nodered/node-red:latest"
    }
    ```
This code creates a Docker image resource in Terraform.

The docker_image resource is used to create and manage Docker images. In this example, we create an image with the name "nodered/node-red:latest".

The name parameter is used to specify the name of the Docker image. The format for a Docker image name is repository:tag.

If the specified image does not exist on the host machine, the Docker provider will pull the image from the registry.

This Terraform code defines a Docker image resource for the latest version of Node-RED.

3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
4. Run `terraform plan` to see the changes that Terraform will make to create the Docker image resource.
5. Run `terraform apply` to create the Docker image resource.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we showed you how to set up a Docker provider in Terraform to start scripting with Docker. With Terraform, you can create and manage infrastructure as code, and using providers makes it easy to integrate with different APIs. Happy scripting!
