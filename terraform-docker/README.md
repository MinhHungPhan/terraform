## Getting Started with Terraform and Docker

### Introduction

A provider in Terraform is an abstraction for a resource API written in a programming language. Terraform supports a variety of providers that can be created for anything with an API, such as cloud providers like Google and Azure, infrastructure providers like VMware or Docker, and even non-IT providers like Domino's Pizza, which once had a Terraform provider for ordering pizza.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to set up a Docker provider in Terraform to start scripting with Docker.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need the following:

- Terraform installed on your machine
- Docker installed on your machine

### Setting Up the Docker Provider

1. Create a new directory for your Terraform code and name it "Terraform Docker".
2. Create a new file named "main.tf" within the "Terraform Docker" directory. You can use any name for this file as long as it ends with ".tf".
3. Add the following code to the "main.tf" file to set up the Docker provider:

   ```terraform
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       docker = {
         source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
         version = "~> 2.0"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "docker" {
   }

4. Save the "main.tf" file.
5. Open a terminal in the "Terraform Docker" directory and run the following command to initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
This command will download the Docker provider and initialize Terraform.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we showed you how to set up a Docker provider in Terraform to start scripting with Docker. With Terraform, you can create and manage infrastructure as code, and using providers makes it easy to integrate with different APIs. Happy scripting!
